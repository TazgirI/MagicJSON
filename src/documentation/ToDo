To make customisation easier, all objects should hold primitive values as the primitive statement objects
    - Does not apply to pre-stored constants like Identifiers, just values input during tokenisation

Cross run memory...





SHOULD I REMOVE FUNCTIONS? All flow can be handled within statements ecspeacilly with the ability to call other Statements, the literal only advantage of Functions is the ability to handle voids and slightly easier to read flow

Statements could handle voids by returning Constants.trueEmpty
Sequences could literally be handled by a sequence StatementObject for stuff like ArgAdd

FUNCTION

- Modifier
    - How do templates work? -> Pass in a function with an input that matches its modifier type

- ArgAdd



STATEMENTS

- ArgBool
