To make customisation easier, all objects should hold primitive values as the primitive statement objects
    - Does not apply to pre-stored constants like Identifiers, just values input during tokenisation

Cross run memory...


Currently compounds exit on first required value (AND on first false and OR on first true), this needs to be configurable



The multiple calls problem:

- Most objects will run .Resolve() once, but some functions like .NumericalTest with numerical compounds will cause multiple
- i.e. LESSTHAN(AND(23 45) OR(5 6)), if you imagine each number is an object, then the objects in And() will call .Resolve twice as Or is forced to run two tests, this doesn't matter for simple objects but if 23 was a sequence, there may be unintended hooks ran twice
- Options:
    - Remove compound comparisons (last ditch)
    - Have compounds compute once on Statement run (also unwanted as it could upset intended arg manipulations)
    - Perform multi comparisons as list versus list rather than foreach(list) versus list....




SHOULD I REMOVE FUNCTIONS? All flow can be handled within statements ecspeacilly with the ability to call other Statements, the literal only advantage of Functions is the ability to handle voids and slightly easier to read flow

Statements could handle voids by returning Constants.trueEmpty
Sequences could literally be handled by a sequence StatementObject for stuff like ArgAdd

FUNCTION

- Modifier
    - How do templates work? -> Pass in a function with an input that matches its modifier type

- ArgAdd



STATEMENTS

- ArgBool
