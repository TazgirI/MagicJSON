4 digit


FIRST FIGURE:

Stage

Criticality

0 = Changes nothing, less than harmless just not what was expected
1 = Potentially something unintentional has happened that may impact the expected outcome
2 = A piece of data or function has failed and resorted to a default or exited, there is unlikely to be a crash but gameplay will not be working as intended
3 = Potential major issue, data or process has been impacted and a crash or serious issue may occur further down the line
4 = Major issue, crash likely imminent
5 = Crash

99 = Not specified


SECOND FIGURE:

0 = PreLoad
1 = Server starting
2 = Server has started and is running
3 = Server is stopping
4 = Server has stopped

99 = Unknown

(Not that if an error occurs after the server has stopped but before the server is starting, it will incorrectly show as occurring when server stopped, if this somehow ever occurs it will be really confusing for the 2 hours before I read this note)


THIRD FIGURE:

Error Location

0 = MagicJSON core
1 = Statement Object
2 = Function Object
3 = MagicJSON peripherals such as testing commands or other non critical infrastructure

11 = Statement Manager
21 = Function Manager

99 = Unknown

FOURTH FIGURE:

Error ID

Always unique, refer to logs or docs

IDS are not shared between Error Locations/the third figure, both statement and function objects can have the error 13 and they cna be completely different



i.e Error 1.0.1.13 is between a minor hiccup or minor data mishandling that is unable (incredibly, incredibly unlikely) to destabilise or impact the experience, it occurred during preloading with a statement object and has the id of 13
